This project introduces an innovative audio-based approach to depression detection using an Operational Neural Network (ONN) architecture. By analyzing voice patterns, the model classifies individuals into three categories: no depression, slight depression, and high depression, with a classification accuracy of 95%. This high accuracy allows for reliable assessment, enabling mental health professionals to quickly and effectively screen individuals at risk.

The ONN architecture streamlines the risk assessment process, significantly reducing the need for manual evaluations and enhancing mental health screening efficiency. This system offers a scalable, accessible tool that could improve early detection and intervention for depression, contributing to better mental health outcomes in various settings.
